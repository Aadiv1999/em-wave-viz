# Electromagentic Waves Visualised
Visualise an EM wave in 3D space.  
Vary the phase angle between the electric and magentic wave to notice the change in Polarization of the EM Wave (keeping the amplitudes the same).  

```
% uncomment to get specific polarization (phi in radians)

%phi = pi; % linear polarization
%phi = pi/2; % circular polarization
```  

## Linear Polarization
Electric and Magnetic Fields have a phase difference of 180 degrees (in phase, multiples of 180)  
The peaks of the electric and magnetic fields when plotted form a straight line

## Circular Polarization
Electric and Magnetic Fields have a phase difference of 90 degrees (out of phase, odd multiples of 90)  
The peaks of the electric and magnetic fields when plotted form a circle

Vary ```phi``` to any other number between 0 and pi to change the type of polarization.
